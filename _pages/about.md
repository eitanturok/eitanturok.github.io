Hi 👋! I'm a Masters student at the Weizmann Institute of Science.

My research interests are in **efficient deep learning**, **representation learning**, and **making GPUs go brrr**.

I spent a year as an **AI research scientist** intern at [MosaicML x Databricks](https://www.mosaicml.com/) where I trained SOTA open source LLMs on thousands of GPUs.

I did my B.S. at [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu/) in **CS, Applied Math**. There I worked on fine-grained complexity with [Josh Alman](https://joshalman.com/), differential privacy with [Rachel Cummings](https://rachelcummings.com/), and non-Euclidean ML with [Professor Itsik Pe'er](https://www.engineering.columbia.edu/faculty/itsik-peer) and [Philippe Chlenski](http://chlenski.com/).
