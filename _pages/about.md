Hi 👋! I'm an **AI research scientist** at [MosaicML x
Databricks](https://www.mosaicml.com/) working on training efficient LLMs with
better data.

My research interests are in **efficient and geometric deep learning**,
**representation learning**, and **making GPUs go brrr**. I used to do research in CS theory on fine-grained complexity and differential privacy.

I graduated from [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu/) with a **B.S.
in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics** in 2023.

At Columbia, I did research with [Professor Itsik
Pe'er](https://www.engineering.columbia.edu/faculty/itsik-peer) and [Philippe
Chlenski](http://chlenski.com/) to develop deep learning models and random
forest algorithms in hyperbolic space. I also worked with [Professor Josh
Alman](https://joshalman.com/) to develop faster algorithms for dynamic programming problems.
