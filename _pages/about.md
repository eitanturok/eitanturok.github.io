Hi 👋! I'm a Masters student at the [Weizmann Institute of Science](https://www.weizmann.ac.il/pages/) where I research **efficient deep learning**, **ML systems**, and **representation learning**.

Previously, I spent a year as an **AI research scientist** intern at [MosaicML x Databricks](https://www.mosaicml.com/) where I trained state-of-the-art open-source LLMs on thousands of GPUs.

I completed my B.S. at [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu/) in **CS, Applied Math**. There I researched fine-grained complexity with [Josh Alman](https://joshalman.com/), differential privacy with [Rachel Cummings](https://rachelcummings.com/), and non-Euclidean ML with [Itsik Pe'er](https://www.engineering.columbia.edu/faculty/itsik-peer) and [Philippe Chlenski](http://chlenski.com/).
